##Assignment:
The assignment is to develop software for an Airport for a private lottery winner. 
The application should print the profits per flight (People in the flight * ticket prices) - ((Fuel price/km)*distance)).

Lastly the software should keep a flight history of all flights, and a list of names with passengers
